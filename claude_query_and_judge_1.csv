0, The output is incorrect. It states that two revenue projections are mentioned in Chart D, while the expected output is simply '53'. These answers are completely different in content and meaning. The output does not provide a specific number as expected, and instead describes a chart that is not mentioned in the expected output.
1, The output correctly addresses revenue projections, which is the core focus of the expected output. While the given output provides more detailed information about a specific scenario in the revenue projections, it still accurately captures the main topic of revenue projections.
1, The output accurately describes the comparison made in Chart D of Appendix I, which aligns with the expected output of 'Base case vs lean model revenue projections'. The output provides more detailed information about the lean model scenario, including specific percentages and numbers, but this additional detail does not contradict the expected output. The core concept of comparing base case and lean model revenue projections is correctly captured.
0, The output provides specific information about a 'lean' model from Chart C, but it does not provide a full financial summary as requested in the expected output. The given response is focused on a particular scenario rather than a comprehensive overview of financial data.
1, The output correctly identifies the type of model as the 'lean' model, which matches the expected output. The addition of the word 'the' and the use of quotation marks in the output do not change the core meaning of the answer.
0, The output states there are four charts mentioned, while the expected output indicates there are two charts. This is a significant discrepancy in the number of charts, not a trivial difference, and therefore the output is incorrect.
1, The output is semantically correct and more detailed than the expected output. While the expected output simply states 'Finance charts', the given output accurately describes financial scenarios, charts, and models, which encompass and expand upon the concept of finance charts. The additional information about revenue projections and student reach for CodePath does not contradict the expected output but provides more context.
0, The output is incorrect. It mentions a value of 56,000 and refers to student reach in 2028, which is not related to the expected output of 52. The output provides a completely different number and context, showing no semantic similarity to the expected answer.
0, The output does not match the expected output at all. The output discusses Charts C and D from Appendix I and a 'lean' model, while the expected output simply states that Chart B shows 'Students enrolled vs expenses per student enrolled'. The output fails to provide the correct information about Chart B's content.
1, The output correctly identifies that Chart A represents the 'base case' financial scenario, which matches the expected output. While the given output provides additional context, the core information about it being the base case is accurate.
0, The output discusses regional advisory boards and their role in CodePath's strategy, while the expected output focuses on companies' contributions through internships, hiring, and funding. These are fundamentally different topics with no significant semantic overlap.
0, The output focuses on CodePath's partnerships with industry volunteers and student leaders, while the expected output specifically mentions partnerships with local corporate consortia and anchor tech employers. Although both discuss partnerships, the nature and targets of these partnerships differ significantly, making the output semantically different from the expected output.
1, The output is semantically correct. While the exact number differs slightly (100,000 vs 103,000), this is a minor discrepancy. The output captures the key information about the projected reach of CodePath by 2028, which is approximately 100,000 students. The use of a precise number versus 'up to' doesn't significantly alter the meaning in this context.
0, The output states that there is no specific information about the number of students CodePath serves at GSU, while the expected output clearly states that CodePath serves 32K GSU students. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected, indicating a significant discrepancy in content.
0, The output is incorrect. It lists specializations that are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output specifies AI, mobile, or entrepreneurship as the specializations, which are completely different from the ones mentioned in the given output (Marketing, Delivery, Revenue, Platform, and Finance & Administration).
0, The output describes a different step in CodePath's approach, focusing on scaling nationally and regionally. The expected output specifically mentions cultivating local philanthropic partnerships and investment, which is not addressed in the given output. These are fundamentally different concepts and strategies, indicating that the output is incorrect.
1, The output is semantically correct and matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output ('The foundation's support enabling CodePath to activate the Miami metro area is') does not change the core information that the Knight Foundation is the correct answer.
0, The output states a time period of 'approximately one year' for the RBDD's commitment, while the expected output specifies a '50% time commitment'. These are fundamentally different concepts. The output describes the duration of involvement, whereas the expected output indicates the intensity or proportion of time dedicated. The information provided in the output, while potentially related, does not accurately convey the expected 50% time commitment.
0, The output states that there is not enough information to determine the timing of RBDD assignment, while the expected output provides a specific timeframe of up to nine months before a region is operational. The output fails to provide the correct information and instead claims insufficient context, making it incorrect.
0, The output provided is entirely different from the expected output. The given output discusses various roles and headcount growth across different departments of CodePath, while the expected output specifically mentions only two roles: Regional Business Development Directors (RBDDs) and Regional Program Managers (RPMs). The content and focus of the two outputs are not semantically similar.
0, The output describes a specific 'flywheel' model used for financial projections and adaptability, while the expected output defines the purpose of a flywheel model as creating cascading impacts through stakeholder engagement. These are fundamentally different concepts and purposes, indicating that the output does not accurately match the expected output.
0, The output is incorrect and does not match the expected answer. The output mentions a national and regional scope, which is not specific to the expected locations. The expected output clearly states two specific regions: New York City (NYC) and DC-Maryland-Virginia metro (DMV). The provided output does not mention these specific locations at all.
0, The output does not match the expected output semantically. The output describes various types of talent that CodePath aims to cultivate and employ, including leadership, staff, volunteers, and student leaders. However, the expected output specifically mentions Black, Latino/a, Indigenous, or low-income (BLI/LI) talent, which is not mentioned in the given output. The two responses are discussing different aspects of talent cultivation and are not semantically similar.
0, The output states that the document does not provide information about the percentage, while the expected output clearly indicates a specific percentage (80%). This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference. The output fails to provide the correct information that is apparently available in the document.
0, The output states that CodePath is planning to expand into 10 targeted metropolitan areas, while the expected output mentions eight targeted metropolitan areas. This is a significant difference in the number of areas, which changes the scale of the expansion plan. Therefore, the output is not accurate compared to the expected output.

0, The output is incorrect as it states that no specific foundation is mentioned, while the expected output clearly identifies the Knight Foundation. This is a significant semantic difference, not a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that no automotive company is mentioned, while the expected output clearly identifies Ford Motor Company as the correct answer. The output fails to provide the requested information and instead discusses an unrelated company (CodePath).
0, The output does not provide the specific number of corporate partners (47) as stated in the expected output. Instead, it gives a general statement about corporate and college customers without mentioning any numerical value. This is a significant difference in content and specificity.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath is the philanthropic partner associated with the Ballmer Group, while the expected output indicates that 'Ballmer Group' itself is the correct answer. These are two different entities, and the output has misidentified the philanthropic partner.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the title of the second section is 'Executive Summary,' while the expected output indicates that it should be '2023-24 Philanthropic Partners.' These are completely different titles with no semantic similarity.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output at all. The output lists general categories of partners or stakeholders, while the expected output specifically names three corporate partners: Alteryx, Amazon, and Asurion. There is no semantic similarity between these two sets of information.
0, The output is incorrect. It states the title as 'CodePath 2024-28 Strategic Plan,' which is completely different from the expected output '2023-24 Corporate Partners.' The years, content, and purpose of the documents are different, indicating a significant semantic mismatch.
0, The output is incorrect as it states there is no mention of a university in Florida, while the expected output clearly identifies the University of Florida in Gainesville. The output fails to provide the correct information and contradicts the expected answer.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that no specific university in New York is mentioned, while the expected output clearly identifies 'New York University'. The output fails to provide the correct information and contradicts the expected answer.
1, The output correctly identifies Texas A&M University as the university located in College Station, Texas. While the phrasing differs slightly from the expected output, the key information is accurate and semantically equivalent.
1, The output is semantically correct. While there are minor differences in formatting (use of 'University of California, Berkeley' instead of 'University of California - Berkeley'), the core information identifying the correct university is accurate. The slight variation in punctuation does not affect the overall meaning or accuracy of the response.
0, The output is incorrect. The expected output is a specific number (46), while the given output states that the document does not specify an exact number of universities. The response discusses other aspects of the document but fails to provide the requested numerical information, which is clearly available in the expected output.
0, The output is partially correct but misses a key component. It correctly identifies corporate and college (university) customers, but fails to mention philanthropic partners, which is a significant omission from the expected output. The semantic content of the answer is incomplete and lacks the full scope of institutions listed in the expected output.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that no specific Ivy League institution is mentioned as a university partner, while the expected output clearly identifies Dartmouth College, which is an Ivy League institution. The output fails to provide the correct information and contradicts the expected answer.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the expected answer of 'Seven' California State Universities. Instead, it states that there is no mention of the specific number in the given document. The output and expected output are semantically different, with the output failing to provide the requested information.
0, The output 'College customers' is incorrect and does not match the expected output 'Alabama A&M University'. These are completely different entities, with no semantic similarity between them. 'College customers' is a generic term, while the expected output is a specific university name.
0, The output states that the title of Appendix G is not provided, while the expected output clearly gives the title as 'University, Corporate, and Philanthropic Partners 2023-24'. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference, so the output is incorrect.
0, The output states that there is no specific information provided about CodePath's revenue percentage from $1M+ gifts, while the expected output clearly states a specific figure of 84%. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.
0, The output does not provide the specific revenue figures requested in the expected output. While it mentions a 'base case' financial scenario and a 'lean' model, it fails to state the actual projected revenue growth from $28.1M in 2023 to at least $44.1M by 2028. The output provides general information about CodePath's financial projections but lacks the precise numerical data required.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific value of $0.05. This indicates that the output is incorrect, as it fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath's philanthropic revenue is intended to be 28% below the base case scenario by 2028, while the expected output indicates 60%. These are significantly different figures and represent opposite directions (below vs. above) in relation to the base case. The output fails to capture the correct percentage and misrepresents the direction of the change.
0, The output states that there is no information provided about MacKenzie Scott's contribution, while the expected output clearly indicates a specific amount of $15M. The output fails to provide the correct information and is therefore incorrect.
0, The output is completely different from the expected output. The output discusses a strategy for high-net-worth individuals and enterprise deals, while the expected output talks about creating regional advisory boards to foster engagement and build a network of supporters. There is no semantic similarity between the two statements.

The semantic meaning is preserved, making this response correct despite the variation in phrasing.
1, The output accurately states that CodePath plans to have 10,000 industry volunteers by 2028, which matches the expected output of '10,000 industry volunteers'. The additional context of the year 2028 in the output does not detract from the core information, which is the number of industry volunteers.
1, The output accurately captures the key information from the expected output. It correctly states the starting headcount of 42 at the end of 2023 and the projected growth to approximately 162 in 2028. The additional phrase 'The projected headcount growth for CodePath' at the beginning of the output does not alter the core information and can be considered as context-setting rather than an inaccuracy.
0, The output states that the exact amount of cash at the end of 2028 is not mentioned, while the expected output provides a specific figure of nearly $67M. This is a significant discrepancy in content, as the output fails to provide the specific information that is available in the expected answer.
0, The output is incorrect. It states a 28% decline in philanthropic investment per student, while the expected output indicates a much larger decrease of nearly 90% (from $3,846 to $441). The magnitude of the change and the specific dollar amounts are significantly different, making the output inaccurate.
0, The output does not provide the specific percentage of earned revenue from colleges (14%) as stated in the expected output. Instead, it claims that this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet and discusses other aspects of the organization. This is a significant semantic difference from the expected answer.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the specific total revenue figure from corporations over five years. The expected output clearly states the amount as $61.8M, while the given output claims there is no specific figure provided and discusses other aspects of the investment. This is a significant discrepancy in the core information requested.
0, The output is incorrect. It states a 28% growth from 2023 to 2028, while the expected output indicates a growth from 8% in 2023 to 41% in 2028, which is a 33 percentage point increase. The output also mentions a 'lean model scenario' and 'Charts C-D of Appendix I', which are not present in the expected output. The core information about the percentage growth is inaccurate.
0, The output is incorrect. It calculates the ratio of staff to students instead of the per-student expense. The expected output of $39 per student is significantly different from the calculated $0.0027 per student. The output fails to consider the actual expenses associated with finance, HR, and operations staff, which would be necessary to calculate the correct per-student expense.
0, The output does not provide the specific decrease in marketing expenses per student as requested in the expected output. While it outlines a method to calculate the decrease, it doesn't actually perform the calculation or provide the final figures of $384 to $83 per student. The response is incomplete and lacks the precise information required.
0, The output is incorrect. While it accurately states that the information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, it fails to provide the correct percentage (71%) that was expected. The expected output gives a specific figure, which the actual output does not mention or approximate.
0, The output does not provide the specific expected amount of $261M. Instead, it gives a general statement about revenue growth without mentioning any precise figure. The response lacks the key information requested in the expected output.
0, The output states that the expected decrease in per-student expenses is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, while the expected output clearly states the specific decrease from $2,215 in 2023 to $599 in 2028. The output fails to provide this key information, which is a significant inaccuracy.

The output focuses on explaining what information is present in the text rather than providing the specific figure requested.
0, The output is incorrect. While it captures the general idea of an increase over time, the specific numbers and units are significantly different from the expected output. The output mentions an increase from 42 to 162, without specifying units, while the expected output clearly states an increase from $16.2M to $59.9M. The magnitude and precision of the figures in the output do not align with the expected values.
0, The output is incorrect. While it accurately states that the provided snippet does not explicitly mention the job success rate, it fails to provide the correct answer of 60%+, which is the expected output. The output instead focuses on other aspects of CodePath's strategic plan, which are not relevant to the specific question about the job success rate.
1, The output is semantically correct. While it doesn't explicitly state '14X', it provides the information from which this can be derived. The increase from ~300 to over 6,000 students represents approximately a 20-fold increase, which is in line with the expected '14X' growth. The slight difference can be attributed to the use of approximate numbers in the output.

The output focuses on revenue growth and student experience, while the expected output clearly states that CodePath's main objective is to provide skills and support to college students at lower-resourced schools to help them access and succeed in the tech economy. These are fundamentally different goals and missions.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the specific number of colleges that partner with CodePath. The expected output clearly states that 116 colleges currently partner with CodePath, while the given output claims that the number is not specified. This is a significant factual discrepancy, not a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output states that there is not enough information to determine the percentage, while the expected output provides a specific percentage (80%). The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information, which was apparently available in the original context.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output in terms of content. While both discuss aspects of CodePath's platform, the output focuses on volunteer and student leader growth, whereas the expected output describes specific personalization features of the learning platform. The three points in the output do not align with the three personalization methods described in the expected output.
1, The output accurately describes CodePath's provision of personalized learning support, albeit in more detail. It mentions learning support for students, which aligns with the expected output of 'Personalized learning support'. The additional information about how this support is delivered (through industry volunteers and student leaders) and the target audience (students in lower-resourced institutions) doesn't contradict but rather enhances the core concept of personalized learning support.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the number of algorithmic challenges is not mentioned in the snippet, while the expected output clearly specifies that there are approximately 200 algorithmic challenges in the Technical Interview Preparation course. The output fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the source material.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the specific answer expected. The output states that the anchor course is not mentioned in the given information, while the expected output clearly identifies 'Technical Interview Preparation' as the anchor course. The output fails to provide this specific information, focusing instead on other aspects of CodePath's organization.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output at all. The output discusses pillars of CodePath's strategic plan (Delivery, Revenue, Platform), while the expected output lists specific practical skills for software engineers (asking for help, building relationships, using feedback, communicating technical choices). The content and focus of these two responses are entirely different, making the output incorrect in relation to the expected answer.
0, The output does not match the expected output semantically. The output mentions skills like leadership, staff management, and systems thinking, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output focuses on collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, which are not present in the given output. While both discuss additional skills for software engineers, the specific skills mentioned are different, indicating a lack of semantic similarity.
0, The output does not accurately reflect the expected output. While the given output describes some aspects of CodePath's programs, it fails to mention the primary focus on transforming college CS education to better support Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income students. The output focuses on general software engineering excellence, while the expected output specifically highlights the goal of supporting underrepresented groups in CS education.
1, The output correctly includes the expected number of 1,330 practicing software engineer volunteers for CodePath. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output is incorrect. While it accurately states that the given snippet does not contain the requested information, it fails to provide the expected answer of $50 trillion. The correct response should have been the specific figure given in the expected output, rather than stating that the information was not available.
0, The output states that there is no information provided about the percentage of Asian CS students transitioning to software engineering jobs, while the expected output clearly indicates a specific percentage (40%). The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that was apparently available.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that no information is provided, while the expected output gives a specific percentage (18.8%) for the 5-year graduation rate of Native American students in four-year STEM bachelor's degree programs. The output fails to provide the correct numerical information.
0, The output does not identify the specific barrier mentioned in the expected output. While the output correctly states that the barrier is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, it fails to infer or guess the expected answer. The expected output identifies a specific barrier: the low graduation rate of BLI/LI young people from college CS programs. The given output does not mention this or any similar barrier, instead focusing on describing the content of the text snippet.
0, While the output correctly identifies some underrepresented groups (Black and Latino/a), it misses key groups mentioned in the expected output (Indigenous, low-income, and first-generation students). The output also includes 'female students' which is not specifically mentioned in the expected output. The semantic content of the two outputs, while overlapping, is not sufficiently similar to be considered correct.
0, The output states that the 5-year completion rate for BLI/LI CS students is not mentioned in the provided information, while the expected output gives a specific figure of ~20%. This indicates that the output missed or failed to identify this key piece of information, making it incorrect in comparison to the expected answer.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to determine the percentage, while the expected output provides a specific figure of 15%. The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the correct percentage, which was apparently available in the expected answer.
0, The output does not provide the specific revenue figure of $261M as stated in the expected output. Instead, it gives a general description of CodePath's revenue plans and the lean model scenario without mentioning the exact total revenue amount. While the output provides relevant context, it fails to directly answer the question with the precise revenue figure.
0, The output does not provide the correct projected cost per student served by CodePath in 2028. The expected output clearly states the cost as $599, while the given output concludes that this information cannot be determined from the provided context. The response fails to provide the specific numerical value requested, which is a critical part of the expected answer.
0, The output states that the snippet does not contain information about CodePath's philanthropic support in 2023, while the expected output provides a specific amount of $28.1M. This indicates that the output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that is clearly available in the expected output.
0, The output provides specific enrollment numbers and a timeline, but does not directly state or calculate the growth factor. The expected output of '14X' indicates a 14-fold increase, which is not explicitly mentioned or easily inferred from the given output. The information provided, while related, does not accurately convey the expected 14X growth.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that CodePath aims to serve over 100,000 students by 2028, which aligns with the expected output of '100,000 students'. The slight difference in phrasing ('over 100,000' vs. '100,000') does not change the core meaning and can be considered a trivial variation.
0, The output states that the economic output loss is not provided in the given snippet, while the expected output clearly states it is 'More than $1 trillion'. The output fails to provide the correct information, indicating a significant discrepancy in content.
0, The output states CodePath's goal is to reach over 6,000 student leaders by 2028, which is significantly different from the expected output of 100,000 students per year. The numbers and timeframes do not align, indicating a substantial discrepancy in the information provided.
0, The output states that no information about the average salary is provided, while the expected output gives a specific figure of $92,000. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units. The output fails to provide the requested salary information, which is clearly available in the expected output.
0, The output states that the information about the number of students served is not mentioned in the provided snippet, while the expected output gives a specific number of 26,000 students. This indicates that the output missed or failed to identify the correct information that was present in the source material.
0, The output states that no information is provided about the percentage of BLI CS graduates landing a tech job within one year, while the expected output gives a specific range of 15-20%. This is a significant discrepancy in content, indicating that the output is incorrect.
1, The output accurately identifies the section that follows 'Introduction to the 2024-28 Plan' as 'Pillar 1: Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth'. The output matches the expected output exactly, including the correct wording and punctuation.
1, The output accurately captures the essence of the expected output. While the phrasing is different, the core concept of 'Sustainable Sources of Revenue' is clearly conveyed in the output's statement about developing sustainable sources of revenue. The semantic meaning is equivalent, despite the difference in wording.
1, The output accurately captures the main concept of Pillar 2 as stated in the expected output. While the phrasing is slightly different, with the output using a full sentence structure and the expected output using a more concise title-like format, the core meaning is the same. Both emphasize improving effectiveness and reducing costs, which are the key elements of Pillar 2.
1, The output accurately states the first pillar of the strategic plan, which is 'Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth.' The content is identical to the expected output, with the only difference being the introductory phrase 'The first pillar of the strategic plan is,' which provides context and does not alter the core information.
1, The output accurately conveys the same time frame as the expected output. While the format is different (full years vs. abbreviated range), the semantic meaning is identical, covering the years 2024 to 2028.
