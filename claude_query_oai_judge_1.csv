0, The output provides detailed information about a revenue projection from Chart D, which is completely different from the expected output of '53'. The output does not match the expected answer semantically or numerically, indicating it is incorrect for this specific question.
1, The output accurately discusses revenue projections, which is the core focus of the expected output. While the output provides more detailed information about a specific 'lean' model scenario, it still fundamentally addresses revenue projections, making it semantically correct in relation to the expected output.
1, The output accurately describes a comparison between a base case and a 'lean' model scenario, which aligns with the expected output of 'Base case vs lean model revenue projections'. The output provides more specific details about the lean model, but the core comparison concept is correctly captured.
0, The output provides specific details about a 'lean' model from Chart C, but it does not provide a full financial summary as requested in the expected output. The given response is focused on a particular scenario rather than offering a comprehensive overview of the financial situation.
1, The output correctly identifies the type of model as the 'lean' model, which matches the expected output. The addition of the word 'the' and the use of quotation marks in the output do not change the core meaning of the answer.
0, The output states there are four charts mentioned, while the expected output indicates there are two charts. This is a significant discrepancy in the number of charts, not a trivial difference, and therefore the output is incorrect.
1, The output is semantically correct and more detailed than the expected output. It accurately mentions that the appendix contains financial scenarios and charts, which aligns with the expected output of 'Finance charts'. The additional details provided in the output do not contradict the expected answer but rather expand upon it.
0, The output is incorrect. It mentions a numerical value of 56,000 referring to student reach in 2028, which is completely different from the expected output of 52. The values, context, and scale are entirely different, indicating a significant discrepancy between the output and the expected answer.
0, The output does not match the expected output semantically. The output discusses the absence of Chart B in a given snippet and mentions comparisons between different financial scenarios. In contrast, the expected output specifically states that Chart B shows 'Students enrolled vs expenses per student enrolled'. The two responses are discussing entirely different content.
1, The output correctly identifies that Chart A represents the 'base case' financial scenario, which matches the expected output. While the given output provides additional context, the core information about it being the base case is accurate.
0, The output discusses the role of regional advisory boards in CodePath's strategy, while the expected output focuses on how companies contribute to regional outcomes through internships, hiring, and funding. These are fundamentally different topics with no significant semantic overlap.
0, The output focuses on CodePath's partnerships with industry volunteers and student leaders, while the expected output specifically mentions partnerships with local corporate consortia and anchor tech employers. Although both discuss partnerships, the nature and targets of these partnerships differ significantly, making the output semantically different from the expected output.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. While the exact number differs slightly (100,000 vs 103,000), this is a minor discrepancy and both figures are in the same order of magnitude. The output also provides additional context about the source of this projection, which doesn't contradict the expected output. The semantic meaning of both statements is essentially the same: CodePath is expected to reach approximately 100,000 students by 2028.
0, The output states that there is no specific mention of the number of students CodePath serves at GSU, while the expected output clearly states that CodePath serves 32K GSU students. The output fails to provide the correct information and instead claims that this information is not available in the given snippet, which is incorrect according to the expected output.
0, The output provided is completely different from the expected output.

The two statements have different focuses and content, making them semantically dissimilar.
0, The output states that the year CodePath.org was launched is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output clearly states the year as 2017. This is a significant factual discrepancy, not a trivial inaccuracy. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that Tim Lee attended the University of California, Berkeley for his bachelor's degree, while the expected output indicates he attended the University of Texas at Austin. These are two different universities in different states, so the information provided is factually incorrect.
0, The output states that Nathan co-founded a software company at age 28, while the expected output is simply '14'. These are completely different pieces of information with no apparent semantic similarity. The age mentioned (28) is also different from the expected number (14). Therefore, the output is incorrect.
1, The output correctly identifies Nathan's role as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), which matches the expected output. The addition of the abbreviation '(CTO)' in the output does not change the meaning and can be considered a helpful clarification rather than an inaccuracy.
0, The output is incorrect as it states there is no information about Michael Ellison's childhood challenges, while the expected output provides specific details about his difficult upbringing, including poverty, homelessness, and having an incarcerated father. The output fails to capture any of these significant life challenges mentioned in the expected answer.
0, The output states that CodePath was founded in 2024, which is incorrect. The expected output indicates that CodePath was founded in 2017. This is a significant factual error regarding the founding year of the organization, not a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that Dana Ledyard previously led 'College Summit', while the expected output indicates she led 'Girls Who Code'. These are two different organizations, and the error is not trivial. The output provides completely different information from what was expected.

This is a significant factual discrepancy, not a trivial inaccuracy. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.
1, The output is correct. It accurately identifies Michael Ellison as the CEO and Co-founder of CodePath, which matches the expected output. The additional information about his role as CEO and Co-founder does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
0, The output is incorrect. The type of revenue discussed in Appendix F is stated as 'sustainable sources of revenue', which is not semantically equivalent to 'Philanthropic Revenue'. These are distinct concepts in the context of organizational funding. Sustainable revenue typically refers to ongoing, self-generated income, while philanthropic revenue specifically relates to charitable donations and grants.
0, The output states there are two appendices, while the expected output indicates nine. This is a significant numerical discrepancy, not a trivial difference. The answers are semantically different and cannot be considered equivalent.
0, The output is completely unrelated to the expected output. The given output discusses details about a lean financial model for CodePath, while the expected output is simply 'Theory of Change'. These are entirely different topics with no semantic similarity.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the information about Corporate Revenue can be found in Appendix I, Chart A of the 'base case' financial scenario. However, the expected output clearly indicates that this information should be in Appendix D. The discrepancy in the appendix letter (I vs D) is significant and not a trivial inaccuracy, as it would lead to looking in the wrong section of the document for the required information.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the title of Appendix A is 'Chart A', while the expected output indicates that the correct title is 'Leadership and Origin Story'. These are completely different titles with no semantic similarity.
0, The output is incorrect. It provides specific numbers (1,330 to 10,000) and a different time frame (2024 to 2028) that are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output indicates growth from 'a few dozen to more than 200 per year', which is a significantly different scale and doesn't specify exact years. The output and expected output are describing different growth metrics and timeframes.
0, The output is incorrect as it states there is no specific information about expected new earnings generation for BLI/LI young people by 2050, while the expected output clearly states 'At least $2 trillion'. The output focuses on unrelated aspects of CodePath's strategic plan, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The two responses are semantically very different and do not convey the same information.
0, The output states that CodePath aims to launch the careers of two million software engineers by 2028, while the expected output indicates the target year is 2050. This is a significant difference in the timeline, changing the scope and urgency of the goal. Therefore, the output is incorrect in terms of the key information provided.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath aims to support over 6,000 student leaders per year by 2028, while the expected output indicates a goal of supporting 100,000 students. The numbers are significantly different, and the output also specifies 'student leaders (Tech Fellows)' instead of just 'students'. This represents a substantial difference in both the scale and the specific target group of CodePath's goal.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the total amount of philanthropic investment is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output clearly specifies the amount as $185M. The output fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the source material.
1, The output correctly includes the year 2023, which matches the expected output exactly. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the specific information requested.
0, The output does not match the expected output in content or specificity. The output mentions a general strategy of developing sustainable revenue sources, while the expected output provides a specific plan to add sales personnel, including a head of sales and various sales roles. These are fundamentally different approaches to growing revenue.
0, The output does not accurately match the expected output. While both mention new positions, the specific roles listed are entirely different. The output mentions general areas like delivery, MEL, engineering, and earned revenue, whereas the expected output lists specific job titles: Director of data and analytics, senior data engineer, data analyst, and data scientist. The output lacks the precision and specificity of the expected answer.
1, The output is essentially correct. While it states '2' engineers and the expected output is '2-3 engineers', this is a minor difference. The output captures the core information that there are approximately 2-3 engineers maintaining the CP Platform, which is semantically similar to the expected output.
0, The output is incorrect. It states a growth factor of 62%, which is significantly different from the expected 14X (1400%) growth. The output describes an increase from 100,000 to 162,000 students, while a 14X growth would imply an increase to 1,400,000 students. The magnitude of growth is substantially underestimated in the given output.
1, The output accurately captures the core purpose of the 'lean' model as described in the expected output. It correctly states that the lean model is designed to demonstrate how CodePath could adapt if projected revenues don't grow as expected. The additional details provided in the output, such as specific numbers and strategies, do not contradict the main point but rather expand on it, providing more context.
1, The output matches the expected output exactly, providing the correct names and titles of the three co-founders of CodePath: Michael Ellison (CEO), Nathan Esquinazi (CTO), and Tim Lee (Chief Learning Officer). The information is accurate and complete.
1, The output accurately captures the three main pillars of CodePath's growth strategy. While the wording is more detailed and slightly different from the expected output, the core concepts are the same. Pillar 1 corresponds to 'Scale', Pillar 2 to 'Delivery' (improving effectiveness and reducing costs), and Pillar 3 to 'Revenue'. The semantic meaning is preserved, making this response correct despite the variation in phrasing.
1, The output accurately states that CodePath plans to have 10,000 industry volunteers by 2028, which matches the expected output of '10,000 industry volunteers'. The additional context of the year 2028 in the output does not detract from the core information, which is the number of industry volunteers.
1, The output accurately captures the key information from the expected output. It correctly states the starting headcount of 42 at the end of 2023 and the projected growth to approximately 162 in 2028. The additional phrase 'The projected headcount growth for CodePath' at the beginning of the output does not alter the core information and can be considered as context-setting rather than an inaccuracy.
0, The output is incorrect as it states there is no specific information about CodePath's expected cash on hand at the end of 2028, while the expected output clearly states a specific amount of nearly $67M. The output fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the source material.
0, The output is incorrect. It states a 28% decline in philanthropic investment per student, while the expected output indicates a much larger decrease of nearly 90% (from $3,846 to $441). The magnitude of the change and the specific dollar amounts are significantly different, making the output inaccurate.
0, The output does not provide the specific percentage of earned revenue from colleges (14%) as stated in the expected output. Instead, it claims that this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet. This indicates a clear discrepancy between the given output and the expected output, suggesting that the response missed or failed to identify key information.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the total revenue from corporations over five years is not explicitly mentioned, when in fact the expected output provides a specific figure of $61.8M. The output fails to provide the correct numerical information and instead discusses unrelated aspects of CodePath's operations.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the percentage of revenue growth is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output provides specific figures: from 8% in 2023 to 41% in 2028. The output fails to identify this key information, which is a significant inaccuracy.
0, The output does not provide the specific per-student expense for finance, HR, and operations in 2028, which is $39 according to the expected output. The response correctly identifies the staff growth but fails to calculate or state the exact per-student cost, instead concluding that there's insufficient information to make the calculation.
0, The output does not provide the correct numerical values for the decrease in marketing expenses per student. While the approach of calculating the ratio of marketing staff to total staff is on the right track, it doesn't directly translate to the expected dollar values. The expected output specifies a decrease from $384 to $83 per student, which is not mentioned or calculated in the given output.
0, The output states that the percentage of total revenues from philanthropy by 2028 is not explicitly mentioned in the snippet, while the expected output provides a specific figure of 71%. This indicates that the output missed or failed to identify this key information, making it incorrect in comparison to the expected answer.
0, The output does not provide the specific revenue figure of $261M as expected. Instead, it describes CodePath's revenue growth expectations and alternative scenarios without mentioning the exact revenue amount. The content, while potentially relevant to CodePath's financial projections, does not directly answer the expected output.
0, The output states that the expected decrease in per-student expenses is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output provides specific figures ($2,215 in 2023 to $599 in 2028). The output fails to provide the correct information that was available in the expected answer.
0, The output does not provide the correct percentage (80%) for the allocation of total plan expenses to scaling and delivering program services. Instead, it states that there is insufficient information to determine the exact percentage. The output focuses on describing the pillars but fails to provide the specific numerical answer expected.
0, The output does not provide the correct total plan expenses for CodePath over five years. The expected output is a specific figure of $217M, while the given output states that the total plan expenses cannot be accurately determined based on the provided information. This indicates a significant discrepancy between the given answer and the expected answer.
0, The output provides detailed information about headcount growth across different departments, but it does not address the overall expense increase from $16.2M to $59.9M as mentioned in the expected output. The numbers and focus of the information are entirely different, making the output incorrect in relation to what was expected.
0, The output is incorrect. While it accurately states that the job success rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, it fails to provide the correct answer of 60%+, which is the expected output. The output focuses on explaining what information is present in the snippet rather than providing the specific job success rate that CodePath aims to maintain.
1, The output is semantically correct. While it doesn't explicitly state '14X', it provides the information from which this can be derived. The increase from 300 to 6,000 students over five years represents a 20-fold increase, which is even greater than the expected 14X. The output effectively conveys the substantial growth expected for CodePath's student reach.
0, The output discusses efficiency, innovation, and program consistency driven by a Technical Readiness Index, which is significantly different from the expected output that focuses on personalization in CodePath programs. The two statements have different core concepts and objectives, making them semantically dissimilar.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the study design is expected to be finalized by 2025, while the expected output indicates it will be finalized during the second quarter of 2024. This is a significant difference in timing and cannot be considered semantically similar or a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output describes a financial scenario analysis with a 'lean' model, which is fundamentally different from a difference-in-differences analysis. A difference-in-differences analysis is a statistical technique used to estimate the effect of a specific intervention or treatment by comparing the changes in outcomes over time between a group that is subject to the intervention and a group that is not. The output does not mention any comparison between groups or over time, which are key elements of a difference-in-differences analysis.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that no specific partner is mentioned, while the expected output clearly identifies Professor Angela Boatman at Boston College as the partner conducting the quasi-experimental study with CodePath. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.

These are fundamentally different objectives, despite both being related to CodePath's programs.
0, The output is completely different from the expected output. It mentions 'Delivery, Revenue, and Platform' as the three work streams, while the expected output lists 'Building MEL capacity and infrastructure, Monitoring data and conducting experiments, Performing long-cycle experiments to measure and improve program efficacy'. The content and concepts in the output do not align with the expected answer at all.
0, The output states that the percentage of projected revenue from national corporate foundations is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output provides a specific figure of 41%. The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the original context.
0, The output does not provide the correct total amount committed for the project. The expected output clearly states $32M, while the given output claims that this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the snippet does not mention a specific goal for the number of donors, while the expected output clearly indicates a goal of 'More than 200 donors' by 2028. The output fails to provide the correct information and instead focuses on unrelated aspects of the organization.
0, The output does not provide the specific percentage increase in philanthropic revenue that was expected. The expected output indicates a 50%-100% increase per year, which is a precise figure. The given output instead states that such specific information is not present in the provided snippet. This is a significant discrepancy in content and specificity, warranting a score of 0.
0, The output states that there is no specific information about the average payment, while the expected output provides a concrete figure of ~$110. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units. The output fails to provide the requested information that is present in the expected output.
0, The output does not provide the specific amount of philanthropic revenue for CodePath in 2023, while the expected output clearly states it as $28.1M. The given output acknowledges a lack of specific information, which is incorrect when compared to the expected precise figure.
0, The output does not provide the specific projected earned revenue for CodePath in 2025, which is $500K according to the expected output. Instead, it gives a general description of potential scenarios and strategies without mentioning the actual figure. The response, while informative about the context, misses the key numerical information requested.
0, The output states that there is no information provided about the percentage of CS professors and administrators who found CodePath's Technical Interview Prep course valuable. However, the expected output clearly indicates that more than 75% found it valuable. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference, so the output is incorrect.
0, The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the specific information requested.

0, The output does not provide the specific revenue figures requested in the expected output. While it describes a 'lean' model and mentions percentages, it fails to state the targeted revenue increase from $400K in 2024 to $5M in 2028 as specified in the expected output. The information provided, though related, does not directly answer the expected revenue figures.
0, The output is incorrect. While it accurately states that the given snippet does not contain the requested information, it fails to provide the correct answer of $1,207, which is the expected output. The output should have stated the specific figure rather than indicating that the information was not available in the given context.
0, The output is incorrect as it states there is no information about the number of companies, while the expected output clearly indicates that 60+ companies attended the Fall 2023 Emerging Engineers Summit hosted by CodePath. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.
0, The output states that the highest annual corporate revenue was not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, while the expected output clearly states a specific figure of $3.8M in 2022. This is a significant discrepancy in content, indicating that the output failed to identify or include this key piece of information.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the exact amount of revenue generated from employers is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output clearly specifies that CodePath earned 'Nearly $10M' from employers in its first four years of selling talent solutions. The output fails to provide this specific revenue figure, which is a key piece of information in the expected answer.
0, The output does not accurately reflect the primary focus of CodePath's training program as stated in the expected output. While the output mentions prioritizing student experience and outcomes, it fails to capture the core focus on teaching modern software development tools and problem-solving skills. The two statements have different emphases and are not semantically equivalent.
0, The output is incorrect compared to the expected output. The output states that CodePath's revenues are '28% below the base case revenue scenario', while the expected output indicates 'More than three-quarters'. These are significantly different statements, both in terms of the percentage and the direction (below vs. more than). The output also includes details about the number of foundations and high-net-worth individuals, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The two statements are not semantically similar.
0, The output describes a broader organizational development plan including leadership hires and succession planning, while the expected output specifically mentions a comprehensive training program with shadowing, observation, and coaching circles. The output does not mention these specific training methods and focuses on different aspects of organizational growth.
0, The output is incorrect. It mentions a new leadership position in 'earned revenue', which is not mentioned in the expected output.

0, The output is incorrect. It states that the new model is called the 'lean' model, while the expected output indicates that the correct name is 'CP Partnered'. These are semantically different names for the model, and the output does not match the expected answer.
1, The output is correct. While it provides a more detailed calculation, the final result of 16.67% is essentially equivalent to the expected output of 'About 17%'. The output shows the correct method of calculation and arrives at a result that is semantically consistent with the expected answer.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that CodePath aims to reach over 100,000 students by 2028, which aligns with the expected output of 100,000 students. The slight difference in phrasing ('over 100,000' vs. '100,000') does not change the core meaning and can be considered semantically equivalent in this context.
0, The output is incorrect. It states a specific number (56,000) and a percentage decrease (28%) which are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output only mentions '60%+', which likely refers to a growth or increase, not a decrease. The output and expected output are semantically different and do not convey the same information.
1, The output conveys the same essential information as the expected output. Both indicate a significant increase in revenue over the given time period. While the specific numbers differ slightly, the scale of growth (roughly 10-15 times increase) is similar. The output uses rounded figures (4 to 45) which approximate the more precise values in the expected output ($2.7M to $30.9M). The semantic meaning of substantial revenue growth over the specified timeframe is accurately captured.
0, The output states that the number of students is not mentioned, while the expected output provides a specific number (7,316 students). This indicates that the output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that is available in the expected output.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the projected annual added earnings for CodePath graduates by 2028 is not explicitly mentioned, when in fact the expected output clearly states it is $5 billion.

1, The output accurately states that CodePath aims to scale to 100,000 students by 2028, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its correctness.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath developed a platform called 'MEL', which is not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output specifically mentions that CodePath developed software to scrape LinkedIn profiles of alumni, which is a different approach and purpose than what is described in the given output. The core information and method of tracking alumni are fundamentally different between the two statements.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the snippet does not contain specific information about the employment success rate of Black CodePath students. However, the expected output clearly provides a specific statistic: 67% of Black CodePath students have achieved full-time employment. This is a significant discrepancy in content and accuracy.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the specific employment rate requested in the expected output. The output states that the given snippet does not contain this information, while the expected output clearly states that 71% of CodePath students who graduated from 2017-2022 have achieved full-time employment in tech. The two responses are semantically very different, with the output failing to provide the key statistic that was expected.

The two sets of questions are not semantically similar and address different aspects of CodePath's operations and impact.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that there is no mention of colleges offering credit for CodePath courses, while the expected output specifically mentions that 22 colleges offer credit. The output fails to provide the correct information and instead focuses on unrelated aspects of CodePath's operations.
0, The output is incorrect and misrepresents CodePath's primary goal. The output focuses on revenue growth and student experience, while the expected output clearly states that CodePath's main objective is to provide skills and support to college students at lower-resourced schools to help them access and succeed in the tech economy. These are fundamentally different goals and missions.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the specific number of colleges that partner with CodePath. The expected output clearly states that 116 colleges currently partner with CodePath, while the given output claims that the number is not specified. This is a significant factual discrepancy, not a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific percentage (80%). The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that was apparently available in the expected answer.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output in terms of content. While both discuss aspects of CodePath's platform, the output focuses on industry volunteers, student leaders, and technology use, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output specifically mentions grouping students, tailoring problem difficulty, and providing technical support, none of which are addressed in the given output. The answers are semantically different and do not align in their key points.
1, The output accurately describes CodePath's provision of personalized learning support, albeit in more detail. It mentions learning support for students, which aligns with the expected output of 'Personalized learning support'. The additional information about how this support is delivered (through industry volunteers and student leaders) and the target audience (students in lower-resourced institutions) doesn't contradict but rather expands on the core concept of personalized learning support.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the number of algorithmic challenges is not mentioned in the provided information. However, the expected output clearly indicates that there are approximately 200 algorithmic challenges in the Technical Interview Preparation course. The output fails to provide this specific numerical information, which is a key detail in the expected answer.
0, The output states that the anchor course is not explicitly mentioned, while the expected output clearly identifies it as 'Technical Interview Preparation'. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording. The output fails to provide the correct information that was expected.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output at all. The output discusses organizational strategies and goals for software engineering education, while the expected output lists specific practical skills that individual software engineers should possess. There is no overlap in content between the two, indicating that the output is completely incorrect in relation to the expected answer.
0, The output mentions skills like leadership, staff management, contractor coordination, and financial management, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The expected output focuses on collaboration, communication, and continuous learning, which are not present in the given output. The two responses are semantically different and do not align in their content.
0, The output provided does not accurately reflect the expected output. While the given output describes some aspects of CodePath's programs, it does not mention the primary focus on transforming college CS education to better support Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and low-income students (BLI/LI). The expected output is more specific about the target audience and the goal of transforming education, which is not captured in the given output.
1, The output correctly includes the expected number of 1,330 practicing software engineer volunteers for CodePath. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output states that the information about estimated economic output loss is not provided in the given snippet, while the expected output gives a specific figure of $50 trillion. These responses are semantically different, indicating that the output is incorrect in relation to the expected answer.
0, The output states that no information is provided about the percentage of Asian CS students transitioning to software engineering jobs, while the expected output clearly indicates a specific percentage (40%). The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that was apparently available.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that no information is provided about the 5-year graduation rate for Native American students in STEM programs, while the expected output clearly gives a specific percentage (18.8%). The output fails to provide the correct numerical information, which is the core of the expected answer.
0, The output states that the primary barrier is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet, while the expected output clearly identifies a specific barrier: the low graduation rate of BLI/LI young people from college CS programs. The output fails to capture this key information, focusing instead on what the text doesn't contain rather than identifying the correct barrier.
0, While the output correctly identifies some underrepresented groups (Black and Latino/a), it misses key groups mentioned in the expected output (Indigenous, low-income, and first-generation students). The output also includes 'female students' which is not specifically mentioned in the expected output. The semantic content of the two outputs, while overlapping, is not sufficiently similar to be considered correct.
0, The output states that no information is provided about the 5-year completion rate, while the expected output gives a specific rate of ~20%. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units. The output fails to provide the requested information that is present in the expected output.
0, The output does not provide the expected percentage (15%) of Black students who complete a college CS degree and enter the industry. Instead, it states that the provided snippet lacks this information. This is a significant semantic difference from the expected output.
0, The output does not provide the specific total revenue amount of $261M as stated in the expected output. Instead, it gives a general description of CodePath's revenue plans without mentioning any exact figures. While the output provides some relevant information about CodePath's financial scenarios, it fails to directly answer the question about the total revenue amount.
0, The output does not provide the specific projected cost per student served by CodePath in 2028. Instead, it describes a method to calculate this figure without giving the actual result. The expected output is a precise value of $599, which is not mentioned or calculated in the given output.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the snippet does not contain information about CodePath's philanthropic support in 2023, while the expected output clearly indicates that the correct amount is $28.1M. The output fails to provide the specific financial figure requested.
0, The output provides specific enrollment numbers and a timeline, but does not directly state or calculate the growth factor. The expected output of '14X' indicates a 14-fold increase, which is not explicitly mentioned or easily inferred from the given output. The information provided, while related, does not accurately convey the expected 14X growth.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that CodePath aims to serve over 100,000 students by 2028, which aligns with the expected output of 100,000 students. The slight difference in phrasing ('over 100,000' vs. '100,000') does not change the core meaning and can be considered semantically equivalent in this context.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the information about economic output loss is not provided in the given snippet, while the expected output clearly indicates that the loss is more than $1 trillion per year. The output fails to identify or mention this specific figure, which is a key piece of information.
0, The output is incorrect. It states CodePath's goal is to reach over 6,000 student leaders by 2028, while the expected output indicates a goal of reaching 100,000 students per year. These numbers are significantly different, and the timeframe is also misrepresented (per year vs. by 2028). The semantic meaning of these two statements is quite different, so the output cannot be considered accurate.
0, The output states that no information about the average salary is provided, while the expected output gives a specific figure of $92,000. This is a significant discrepancy in content, not just a trivial difference in wording or units. The output fails to provide the requested salary information, which is clearly available in the expected output.
0, The output does not provide the correct information about the number of students CodePath has served. The expected output clearly states that CodePath has served 26,000 students over the past seven years, while the given output claims this information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided snippet. This is a significant factual discrepancy, not a trivial inaccuracy.
0, The output states that no information is provided about the percentage of BLI CS graduates landing a tech job within one year, while the expected output gives a specific range of 15-20%. This is a significant discrepancy in content, indicating that the output is incorrect.
1, The output is correct as it includes the expected answer 'Pillar 1: Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth' as the first item in the list. The output provides additional sections that follow, but this does not detract from the accuracy of the specific information requested.
1, The output accurately identifies that Pillar 3 in the strategic plan is about developing sustainable sources of revenue, which aligns with the expected output 'Sustainable Sources of Revenue'. The output provides additional context but maintains the core concept, demonstrating semantic similarity.
1, The output accurately captures the main concept of Pillar 2 as stated in the expected output. While the phrasing is slightly different, with the output using a full sentence structure and the expected output using a more concise title-like format, the core meaning is the same. Both emphasize improving effectiveness and reducing costs, which are the key elements of Pillar 2.
1, The output accurately identifies the first pillar of the strategic plan as 'Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth'. The additional text 'The first pillar of the strategic plan outlined in the snippet is' does not affect the correctness of the core information provided.
1, The output accurately conveys the same time frame as the expected output. While the format is different (full years vs. abbreviated range), the semantic meaning is identical, covering the years 2024 to 2028.
