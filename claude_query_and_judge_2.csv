0, The output is completely different from the expected output. The output describes a chart comparing two revenue projections, while the expected output is simply the number 53. There is no semantic similarity between these answers.
1, The output is correct as it accurately describes the content of revenue projections, which is the core of the expected output. While the given output provides more detailed information about the specific aspects of the revenue projections, it still fundamentally addresses the expected topic of 'Revenue projections'.
1, The output accurately captures the main content of the expected output. The only difference is the addition of 'Chart D compares the' at the beginning and quotation marks around the key phrase, which do not alter the core meaning. The essential information about comparing base case vs lean model revenue projections is correctly conveyed.
0, The output is incorrect. It specifically mentions 'Chart C' and 'lean model', which are not present in the expected output. The expected output is simply 'Full financial summary' without any reference to a chart or model.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. Both refer to the 'lean model'. The output includes additional words ('The type of model discussed in Chart C is the') but this does not change the core meaning of the answer.
1, The output correctly identifies that there are two charts mentioned in the document excerpt, which matches the expected output of 'Two charts.' While the output provides additional details about the specific charts, this extra information does not detract from the core accuracy of the answer.
1, The output correctly includes 'Finance charts' as one of the items listed in the appendices (specifically, Appendix I). While the output provides much more information than just 'Finance charts', it does accurately contain the expected output within its comprehensive list.
0, The output states the numerical value as 32, which is different from the expected output of 52. These are two distinct numbers, and the difference is significant enough to be considered incorrect.
1, The output accurately describes the comparison shown in Chart B, which is between the number of students enrolled and the expenses per student enrolled. The output provides more detail than the expected output, but the core information is semantically equivalent.
1, The output correctly identifies that Chart A represents the 'Base case' as stated in the expected output. The additional context provided in the output ('in the document') does not change the core meaning and can be considered supplementary information.
0, The output does not match the expected output semantically. The output states that there is not enough information to determine the role of regional advisory boards, while the expected output specifically mentions that companies contribute through internships, hiring, and funding commitments. The output fails to capture the key information about the companies' contributions to regional outcomes.
0, The output describes CodePath's partnerships with higher education institutions, detailing two models: CodePath Partnered and CodePath Partnered+. However, the expected output specifically mentions partnerships with local corporate consortia and anchor tech employers. The content and focus of the output are entirely different from what was expected, discussing educational partnerships rather than corporate partnerships.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that CodePath's potential reach is up to 103,000 students across the region. While the output provides more detail than the expected output, the core information is correct. The use of '103,000' instead of '103K' is a trivial difference that doesn't affect the accuracy of the answer.
0, The output is significantly different from the expected output. It mentions 103,000 students across the region, while the expected output specifically refers to 32K GSU students. The numbers and scope of students are not semantically similar.
1, The output correctly identifies the three specializations mentioned in the expected output: AI (Artificial Intelligence), mobile, and entrepreneurship. While the output provides additional context, it does not alter the core information, which accurately matches the expected answer.
1, The output accurately includes the key point from the expected output about cultivating local philanthropic partnerships and investment, with specific mention of the lead funder. While the output provides additional information about activating local alumni and developer community, this extra detail does not detract from the core accuracy of the response.
1, The output correctly identifies the Knight Foundation as the entity providing support to CodePath, which matches the expected output. The additional information about the specific grant and its impact on the Miami metro area does not detract from the accuracy of the core answer.
1, The output accurately states the 50% time commitment, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output about the duration (six months prior to launch until six months post-launch) and the role (RBDD) does not contradict the core information, and can be considered as supplementary details that do not affect the accuracy of the main point.
1, The output conveys the same essential information as the expected output. Both indicate that something happens up to nine months before a region becomes operational. The output provides additional detail about an RBDD being assigned, but this doesn't contradict the expected output. The core timing information is consistent between the two.
1, The output accurately identifies the key roles mentioned in the expected output: Regional Business Development Directors (RBDDs) and Regional Program Managers (RPMs). While the output provides additional context about CodePath employing these roles to staff regions, this extra information does not detract from the core accuracy of the response. The essential information is present and correct.
1, The output accurately captures the essence of the 'flywheel' model described in the expected output. While the output provides more detailed information, it correctly identifies the core purpose of creating a self-reinforcing cycle (cascading impacts) by engaging local stakeholders to develop the workforce and promote social mobility. The output elaborates on the stakeholders involved and the specific goals, but it aligns with the main concept presented in the expected output.
1, The output accurately identifies the two regions mentioned in the expected output: New York City (NYC) and the DC-Maryland-Virginia metro (DMV). The additional phrase 'The regions indicated for potential CodePath launches in Spring 2025 are' does not affect the core information, which matches the expected output perfectly.
1, The output correctly identifies the target demographic as 'Black, Latino/a, Indigenous, or low-income (BLI/LI) talent', which matches the expected output. The additional context about CodePath's aims does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output correctly states the percentage (80%) of early career talent working within 100 miles of their hometown, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output correctly identifies the key information about eight targeted metropolitan areas, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output (about CodePath's expansion plans over five years) does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
0, The output is partially correct but includes an additional institution (Capital One Foundation) that is not mentioned in the expected output. This extra information makes the answer inaccurate compared to the expected output, which only lists JP Morgan Chase Foundation.
0, The output is incorrect. The expected output is simply 'MacKenzie Scott', which is the name of the foundation associated with her. The provided output incorrectly states that no foundation name is mentioned, when in fact, MacKenzie Scott's name itself is used as the foundation name. The output misinterprets the question and provides an explanation instead of the direct answer.
0, The output provided is a long list of technology companies, but it does not include Google, which is the only company mentioned in the expected output. While the output does contain many valid technology companies, it completely misses the specific company that was expected. Therefore, the answer is incorrect in terms of matching the expected output.
1, The output correctly identifies the Knight Foundation as the philanthropic foundation mentioned in the document. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy, as the core information (Knight Foundation) matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly identifies Ford Motor Company as the company associated with the automotive industry in the provided snippet. The output matches the expected output exactly, with no discrepancies in content or meaning.
0, The output states there are 45 corporate partners, while the expected output indicates 47. This is a numerical discrepancy that affects the accuracy of the information, even if it's a small difference.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath is the philanthropic partner associated with the Ballmer Group, while the expected output indicates that 'Ballmer Group' itself is the correct answer. These are two different entities, and the output has misidentified the philanthropic partner.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the title of the second section is 'Appendix B: CodePath Founding Principles,' which is completely different from the expected output '2023-24 Philanthropic Partners.' These titles are not semantically similar and refer to different content.
0, The output is largely incorrect. While it correctly identifies Amazon as one of the corporate partners, it incorrectly lists Boeing and Microsoft, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The output is missing two of the three correct partners: Alteryx and Asurion. The accuracy is low, with only one out of three partners correctly identified.
0, The output 'The title of the document excerpt is "Appendices."' is completely different from the expected output '2023-24 Corporate Partners'. These are two distinct titles with no semantic similarity, indicating that the output is incorrect.
0, The output mentions Florida State University, while the expected output specifies University of Florida - Gainesville. These are two different universities in Florida. Although both are located in Florida, they are distinct institutions, so the answer is incorrect.
1, The output is correct as it includes New York University, which is the only university mentioned in the expected output. While the output lists additional universities, it does not detract from the accuracy of including the expected answer. The output provides more comprehensive information but still contains the correct expected response.
1, The output correctly identifies Texas A&M University - College Station as the university located in College Station, Texas. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output correctly identifies the University of California - Berkeley as the university located in California with 'Berkeley' in its name. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the core information, which matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output states that there are 91 universities listed, while the expected output indicates 46. This is a significant numerical discrepancy that cannot be attributed to trivial inaccuracies. The answers are semantically different and represent distinct quantities.
0, The output discusses higher education institutions in general, while the expected output specifically mentions 'University, Corporate, and Philanthropic Partners'. The output fails to mention corporate or philanthropic partners, which are key components of the expected answer. The content and focus of the two outputs are significantly different, indicating a lack of semantic similarity.
1, The output correctly identifies Dartmouth College as the Ivy League institution mentioned as a university partner. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy, as the core information matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly identifies that there are seven California State Universities mentioned in the document. The expected output 'Seven' matches the conclusion in the given output that 'there are 7 California State Universities mentioned in the document'. The output provides additional detail by listing the specific universities, but the core information about the number of universities is accurate.
0, The output is incorrect. It states Arizona State University as the university partner, while the expected output is Alabama A&M University. These are two different universities in different states, so the information provided is not semantically similar or accurate.
0, The output is partially correct but missing a crucial part. While it correctly identifies 'University, Corporate, and Philanthropic Partners' as part of the title, it omits the year '2023-24' which is included in the expected output. This omission changes the specificity of the title and thus cannot be considered fully accurate.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific percentage (84%). This indicates that the output is incorrect, as it fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available.
0, The output is incorrect. It provides percentages of revenue growth (8% to 41%) instead of the actual revenue figures. The expected output gives specific dollar amounts ($28.1M to $44.1M) which are not reflected in the given output. The information provided in the output is fundamentally different from what was expected.
1, The output correctly includes the expected value of $0.05, which represents the amount CodePath spent internally per $1.00 of philanthropy secured in 2023. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly states that CodePath aims for renewed or upgraded philanthropy to represent 60% of all philanthropic revenue by 2028, which aligns with the expected output of 60%. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output is semantically correct. The amount stated in the output ($15 million) is equivalent to the expected output ($15M). The difference is merely in the format of representation, with the output using the full word 'million' instead of the abbreviation 'M'. This does not affect the accuracy of the information provided.
1, The output accurately includes the creation of regional advisory boards to foster engagement, which is the key point in the expected output. While the output provides additional strategies beyond what was explicitly mentioned in the expected output, it does not contradict or detract from the main point. The output elaborates on how these boards and other initiatives will help build a network of supporters, which aligns with the intent of the expected output.
1, The output correctly states the expected annual growth rate of 30-40%, which matches the expected output exactly. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output accurately captures the key point from the expected output, which is that the national foundation partners will help unlock regional funder support. While the output provides additional context and details, it still includes the core concept expected in the answer.
1, The output correctly includes the expected value of $18,401,500. The additional context provided in the output ('The corporate philanthropy is expected to generate') does not alter the accuracy of the numerical figure, which is the key information.
1, The output matches the expected output exactly. The total projected philanthropic revenue of $184,850,000 is correctly stated in the output.
1, The output accurately states the projected increase in philanthropic investors for CodePath from 82 to over 230 between 2023 and 2028. While it doesn't mention the 70% increase explicitly, the core information about the numerical change is correct, which is the most crucial part of the projection. The omission of the percentage doesn't significantly alter the main message of the projection.
1, The output correctly states that MacKenzie Scott contributed $15 million to CodePath in 2023, which matches the key information in the expected output. The additional information about other donors does not contradict the expected output and can be considered supplementary detail.
1, The output is semantically correct. The amount stated in the output ($2.5 million) is equivalent to the expected output ($2.5M). The only difference is in the representation of 'million', which is spelled out in the output and abbreviated in the expected output. This is a trivial difference that doesn't affect the accuracy of the information provided.
0, The output is incorrect. The question asked for the number of philanthropic investor segments, and the expected output is 'Four'. However, the given output lists only three main segments: 1) Investors at the $1M+ revenue level, 2) Regional and high-net-worth individual investors, and 3) Individual contributors. The output does not match the expected answer of four segments.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that over 40% of CodePath's philanthropic revenues came from national corporate foundations. The additional details in the output (specifying the years 2021-23 and using the term 'contributed') do not contradict the expected output and provide more context without changing the core meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the expected average salary of $92,000 for graduates who landed full-time tech jobs after completing CodePath's program. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output states that CodePath has served 20,344 unique students, while the expected output indicates 26,000 students. These numbers are significantly different, with a discrepancy of over 5,000 students. The output is therefore not accurate in terms of the number of students served.
0, The output does not provide the correct percentage (90%) as stated in the expected output. Instead, it explains that there's insufficient information to calculate the percentage. While the explanation is logical given the information provided in the output, it doesn't match the expected answer of 90%.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. The only difference is in the format: '$28.1 million' vs '$28.1M'. The numerical value (28.1) and the unit (million/M) are the same, making the answers effectively identical in meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the expected range of 50%-100% increase in philanthropic revenue. While the output provides additional context about this being per year for the last three years, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output in content or focus. The output discusses strategies for mitigating risks in generating revenue from higher education institutions, while the expected output mentions prioritizing experienced hires, investing in flagship university partnerships, and improving data systems. These are fundamentally different approaches and strategies, indicating that the output is not accurate in relation to the expected answer.
0, The output provides a detailed analysis but does not directly state that the percentage of total revenue from higher education is never more than 7%. While the analysis is thorough, it misses the key point of the expected output, which provides a specific upper limit for the percentage.
0, The output states that CodePath aims to achieve over $25M in revenue by 2028, while the expected output indicates $5.1M. This is a significant difference in the stated revenue target, making the output incorrect.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that the expected cost will exceed $4, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its correctness.
1, The output correctly states that CodePath plans to grow its higher ed account team to 7 FTEs by 2028, which matches the expected output of 7 FTEs. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
0, The output states that CodePath plans to enroll 45,000 students per year by 2028, while the expected output is 24,340. These are significantly different numbers, and the output does not match the expected information. The output also includes additional context about a 'CodePath Partnered model' which is not present in the expected output. Therefore, the response is incorrect.
1, The output is semantically correct. While it states 'approximately $200' instead of the exact $206, this is a reasonable approximation and conveys the same general cost information. The slight difference is trivial and does not significantly alter the meaning or understanding of the cost per student.
0, The output states the projected average deal size per school in 2028 is $44.5K, which is significantly lower than the expected output of more than $400,000. The difference is too large to be considered a trivial inaccuracy or unit conversion error.
0, The output does not provide the specific number of higher education institutions (58) that CodePath plans to collaborate with. Instead, it focuses on the number of students (45,000) and the timeline (by 2028), which are not the key information requested in the expected output. The output explicitly states that the number of institutions is not provided, which is incorrect as the expected output clearly specifies 58 institutions.
1, The output is essentially correct. While the exact figure in the output ($2.6M) differs slightly from the expected output ($2.5M), this is a minor discrepancy that doesn't significantly alter the meaning of the response. The difference of $0.1M is relatively small in this context and could be due to rounding or a slight variation in projections. The core information about a substantial revenue increase for CodePath Partnered by 2028 is accurately conveyed.
1, The output correctly states the initial pricing test for CodePath Partnered is $75 per student per year, which matches the expected output of $75. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. The only difference is in the format: '$5.1 million' vs '$5.1M'. The numerical value (5.1) and the unit (millions of dollars) are the same, making the answers effectively identical in meaning.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information present in the expected output. It correctly states the number of universities (313) and the percentage of America's 4-year undergraduate computing students they educate (73%). The addition of 'CodePath targets partnerships with' does not alter the core information and can be considered supplementary context rather than an inaccuracy.
1, The output correctly identifies and describes the two variations of the partnership model offered by CodePath: CodePath Partnered and CodePath Partnered+. The response provides detailed explanations of each model, which aligns with the expected output. While the output goes beyond the simple naming of the two models, the additional information does not detract from the accuracy of the answer.
0, The output is incorrect as it states that the document does not provide information about U.S. postsecondary institutions' total annual spending, while the expected output clearly indicates a specific figure of $700B+. The output focuses on CodePath's finances, which is not relevant to the question about overall U.S. postsecondary spending.
1, The output is semantically correct. While the expected output uses an abbreviated form ($418K), the actual output provides the full amount ($418,000), which is equivalent. The output also includes additional context about the survey, but this does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. Both indicate that approximately 30 professors were involved. The additional context in the output (mentioning CodePath and the timeframe since September 2023) does not contradict the core information, and such elaboration should not be penalized.
0, The output states that there is not enough information to provide an answer, while the expected output gives a specific value of $140,000+. This indicates that the output is incorrect, as it fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the given context.
0, The output states that it cannot provide an answer due to lack of information, while the expected output gives a specific percentage (43%). The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that was apparently available.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information from the expected output, stating that confidence in higher education is at an all-time low. While the output provides additional context and details, it does not contradict or misrepresent the core message of the expected output. The semantic meaning is preserved, making the response correct in essence.
1, The output accurately captures the key concept of CodePath achieving efficiencies in program delivery as a means to enhance long-term sustainability. While the output provides more detailed information than the expected output, it does not contradict it. Both emphasize the importance of efficiency and growth in earned revenue for CodePath's sustainability. The additional details in the output about marginal revenue exceeding marginal cost and increasing philanthropic impact are consistent with the overall idea of efficiency and growth mentioned in the expected output.
0, The output provided is significantly different from the expected output. While the given output describes various strategies for strengthening relationships with employers, it does not specifically mention cultivating relationships at multiple levels within each employer or finding technical sponsors and HR champions, which are the key points in the expected output. The provided answer, though detailed, does not align with the specific approach mentioned in the expected output.
0, The output provides specific financial projections about a decline in marginal earned revenue, while the expected output simply states that it will exceed marginal cost. These are fundamentally different statements about different aspects of financial performance, so they cannot be considered semantically similar.
1, The output accurately captures the key information from the expected output. It correctly identifies mobilizing the alumni base as advocates and customers for CodePath products as a strategy to mitigate risks. The additional context provided in the output ('One strategy CodePath plans to use to mitigate risks is') does not alter the core meaning and can be considered as supplementary information that doesn't detract from the accuracy of the response.
1, The output accurately captures the key points from the expected output. It mentions the three main reasons for the mismatch in growth projections: mismatch with customer needs, customers favoring competitors' offerings, and preference for in-house solutions. The output provides slightly more context by mentioning 'reasons for the mismatch in growth projections,' but the core information is semantically equivalent to the expected output.
1, The output accurately captures all three key internal risks mentioned in the expected output. It provides the same information but in a more structured, numbered format. The content is semantically equivalent, covering growth pains in scaling, fractional leadership issues, and the risk associated with a small team size.
1, The output correctly includes the year 2028, which matches the expected output. Although the output provides additional information about CodePath's revenue goal, it accurately contains the specific year requested.
0, The output is incorrect. The expected output is a specific percentage (85%), while the provided output states that there is no information about client renewal rates in the given text. These are semantically different answers, as one provides a precise figure and the other claims an absence of information.
1, The output correctly states the expected cost of corporate sales per $1 of earned revenue in 2026 as $0.70, which matches exactly with the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not affect the accuracy of the core information.
0, The calculated total projected revenue in the output ($50,700,277) is significantly different from the expected output ($61,811,985). The discrepancy is too large to be attributed to rounding errors or minor calculation mistakes. This suggests that there might be an error in the data used or in the calculation method employed in the output.
1, The output exactly matches the expected output. Both state the projected revenue for off-the-shelf talent solutions in 2025 as $1,906,507.
1, The output correctly identifies the three sectors mentioned in the expected output: defense, retail, and financial services (referred to as 'finance' in the output). While the output provides additional context and explanation, the core information aligns with the expected answer. The semantic content is accurate and matches the expected output.
1, The output accurately calculates the increase in revenue from customized talent solutions between 2024 and 2028. While the output provides more detailed figures ($2,088,348 and $15,003,487) compared to the rounded figures in the expected output ($2M and $15M), the essence of the information is the same. The calculation of the increase ($12,915,139) is correct and consistent with the given information. The minor difference in precision does not affect the overall accuracy of the answer.
1, The output correctly identifies CareerConnect as CodePath's tech-enabled talent matching solution, which matches the expected output exactly. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. It correctly states the starting revenue of $400K and the target revenue of $5M, as well as the correct years (2024 and 2028). The phrasing is slightly different, but the core information and meaning are identical.
1, The output correctly includes the expected number of 13,400 unfilled computer science jobs by 2030. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the key information.

1, The output correctly identifies the title of Appendix A as 'Leadership and Origin Story'. The additional text 'The title of Appendix A is' in the output does not change the core information, which matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output is semantically similar to the expected output. Both indicate a significant growth in the number of donors, from a relatively small number to over 200. The specific numbers (82 to 230) in the output align with the general description ('a few dozen to more than 200') in the expected output. The slight difference in phrasing and specificity does not affect the core meaning.
0, The output states that there is not enough information to answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific figure of at least $2 trillion. This indicates that the output missed or failed to identify relevant information that was presumably available in the source material.
0, The output is incorrect. The expected output states a specific year (2050) by which CodePath aims to launch the careers of two million software engineers. However, the provided output claims that no specific goal or target year is mentioned in the given information. This is a significant discrepancy in the core information, not a trivial inaccuracy.

0, The output provided is completely unrelated to the expected output. The given output discusses CodePath's educational model and curriculum, while the expected output is about demonstrating adaptability in case of lower-than-projected revenue growth. These are entirely different topics with no semantic similarity.
1, The output correctly identifies the three co-founders of CodePath: Michael Ellison, Tim Lee, and Nathan Esquenazi. While it doesn't include their specific roles or titles as mentioned in the expected output, the core information about the co-founders' identities is accurate. The order of names is slightly different, but this doesn't affect the overall correctness of the answer.
0, The output does not match the expected pillars. While the output mentions three points, they are different from the expected pillars of Scale, Delivery, and Revenue. The output focuses on relationships, revenue, and equity, which do not align semantically with the expected pillars. The only partial match is the mention of revenue, but it's not enough to consider the answer correct.
1, The output accurately states that CodePath plans to have 10,000 industry volunteers by 2028, which matches the expected output of '10,000 industry volunteers'. The additional context of the year 2028 in the output does not detract from the core information, which is the number of industry volunteers.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. It correctly states the projected headcount growth for CodePath from 42 staff members at the end of 2023 to approximately 162 staff members in 2028. The output provides additional context by mentioning 'CodePath' and 'staff members', but the core numerical information and timeframe match the expected output exactly.
0, The output is incorrect. While it provides a detailed explanation about the lack of specific information, the expected output clearly states a specific amount: 'Nearly $67M'. The output fails to provide this specific figure and instead concludes that it's not possible to determine the cash on hand, which contradicts the expected answer.
0, The output does not provide the correct calculation or figures. It states that there is insufficient information to calculate, while the expected output gives a specific decline percentage and dollar amounts. The output misses the key information of a nearly 90% decline from $3,846 to $441 per student.
1, The output correctly states that revenue from colleges accounts for 14% of earned revenue, which matches the expected output of 14%. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. The only differences are the spelling out of 'million' instead of using 'M' as an abbreviation, and the inclusion of the word 'total' and additional context. The core information - the amount of $61.8 million - is correct and matches the expected output.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. It includes the correct percentage growth from 8% in 2023 to 41% in 2028. The additional phrase 'The percentage of revenues is expected to grow' does not alter the core information and can be considered as providing context rather than changing the meaning.
1, The output matches the expected output exactly in terms of the numerical value and unit ($39 per student). The additional context provided in the output ('The per-student finance, HR, and operations expense in 2028 will be') does not alter the core information and can be considered as supplementary detail that doesn't affect the accuracy of the answer.
1, The output accurately states the decrease in marketing expenses per student from $384 to $83, which matches the expected output. The additional context mentioning 'Pillar 1 (Scaling)' does not detract from the correctness of the core information.
0, The output is incorrect as it fails to provide the expected percentage (71%) and instead states that there's not enough information to calculate the percentage. The output demonstrates a misunderstanding of the available data or misses some crucial information that would allow for the calculation of the correct percentage.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. While the format is different (full sentence vs. abbreviated form), the key information of $261 million is correctly stated. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. Both state that the per-student expenses decrease from $2,215 in 2023 to $599 in 2028. The slight difference in phrasing does not affect the core meaning or accuracy of the information provided.

1, While the output is more detailed than the expected output, it accurately captures the core purpose of the Technical Readiness Index. Both emphasize the goal of helping students get hired as software engineers. The output elaborates on how this is achieved through personalization and prediction, which aligns with the expected output's statement of providing 'exactly what they need'. The semantic meaning is consistent, even though the wording differs.
1, The output accurately describes the three complementary work streams of CodePath's MEL work. It provides more detailed explanations for each work stream, but the core concepts match the expected output. The three streams - building capacity and infrastructure, monitoring data and conducting experiments, and performing long-cycle experiments - are all correctly identified and elaborated upon.
0, The output does not provide the correct percentage (41%) that was expected. Instead, it states that there is insufficient information to calculate the percentage. While the output provides a detailed explanation of why the calculation cannot be made based on the given information, it fails to arrive at the specific expected answer of 41%.
0, The output states a total amount of $185 million, which is significantly different from the expected output of $32M. This is not a trivial difference in units or abbreviation, but a substantial discrepancy in the reported amount.
1, The output is semantically correct. While the specific numbers differ slightly (230 vs 200), both indicate 'more than 200' donors. The output provides a more specific target but still aligns with the expected 'more than 200' goal. The use of 'philanthropic investors' instead of 'donors' does not change the core meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the expected range of 50%-100%. While the output provides additional context about this being an annual increase over the last three years, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly states that the average payment per student for CodePath's college customers by 2028 is approximately $110. This matches the expected output of '~$110'. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the core answer.
1, The output is semantically correct. While the format differs slightly (spelling out 'million' instead of using 'M'), the core information - the amount of $28.1 million - is accurate and matches the expected output. The additional context about it being CodePath's total philanthropic revenue in 2023 does not detract from the correctness of the answer.
0, The output ($6,355,024) is significantly different from the expected output ($500K). The difference is too large to be considered a trivial inaccuracy or unit conversion error. The output is over 12 times larger than the expected value, indicating a substantial discrepancy in the projected revenue figures.
0, The output states 'Approximately 70%' while the expected output is 'More than 75%'. These are semantically different, as 70% is not more than 75%. The discrepancy is significant enough to be considered incorrect, despite both referring to a high percentage of positive responses.
