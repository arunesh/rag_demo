0, The output provides a detailed explanation about Chart D and revenue projections, which is completely unrelated to the expected output of '53'. The two responses have no semantic similarity or connection, indicating that the output is incorrect.
1, The output accurately describes revenue projections, which is the core concept mentioned in the expected output. While the output provides more detailed information about specific percentages and time frames, it fundamentally addresses the topic of revenue projections for CodePath, comparing different scenarios over time. The additional details do not detract from the main focus of revenue projections.
1, The output accurately captures the main content of the expected output. The only difference is the addition of 'Chart D compares the' at the beginning and quotation marks around the key phrase, which do not alter the core meaning. The essential information about comparing base case vs lean model revenue projections is correctly conveyed.
0, The output is incorrect. It specifically mentions 'Chart C' and 'lean model', which are not present in the expected output. The expected output is simply 'Full financial summary' without any reference to a chart or model.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. Both refer to a 'lean model'. The output includes additional quotation marks and uses 'The type of model discussed in Chart C is a' as a prefix, but these do not change the core meaning of the answer.
1, The output correctly identifies that there are two charts mentioned in the document, which matches the expected output. While the output provides additional details about the charts' labels and location, this extra information does not detract from the core accuracy of the answer.
1, The output correctly includes 'Appendix I: Finance Charts' which matches the expected output of 'Finance charts'. While the output provides additional information about other appendices, it does not detract from the accuracy of including the expected information.
0, The output states the numerical value as 32, which is different from the expected output of 52. These are two distinct numbers, and the difference is significant enough to be considered incorrect.
1, The output accurately describes the comparison in Chart B as being between the number of students enrolled and the expenses per student enrolled. This is semantically equivalent to the expected output of 'Students enrolled vs expenses per student enrolled'. The output provides more detail but conveys the same core information.
1, The output correctly identifies that Chart A represents the 'Base case' as stated in the expected output. The additional context provided in the output ('in the document') does not change the core meaning and can be considered supplementary information.
0, The output does not address the specific point mentioned in the expected output. The output discusses CodePath's regional expansion model and involvement of local stakeholders, but it does not mention the role of companies in contributing to regional outcomes through internships, hiring, and funding commitments. The content of the output, while related to CodePath's strategy, is semantically different from the expected output.
0, The output describes CodePath's partnerships with higher education institutions, detailing two types of partnerships (CodePath Partnered and CodePath Partnered+) aimed at colleges and universities. However, the expected output mentions partnerships with local corporate consortia and anchor tech employers, which is not addressed in the given output. The content and focus of the two descriptions are entirely different, making the output incorrect in relation to the expected answer.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that CodePath could potentially reach up to 103,000 students across the region. While the output provides more detail and context than the expected output, the core information is consistent. The use of '103,000' instead of '103K' is a trivial difference that doesn't affect the semantic meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the key information about 32,000 GSU students, which matches the expected output of '32K GSU students'. The additional information about CodePath reaching 103,000 students across the region does not contradict the expected output and can be considered supplementary detail. The use of '32,000' instead of '32K' is a trivial difference in representation and does not affect the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output accurately lists the specializations mentioned in the expected output (AI, mobile, and entrepreneurship). The additional context provided in the output ('According to the document, students can take on specializations such as...') does not detract from the correctness of the core information.
1, The output accurately includes the key point from the expected output about cultivating local philanthropic partnerships and investment, with specific mention of the lead funder. While the output provides additional information about activating local alumni and developer community, this extra detail does not detract from the core accuracy of the response.
1, The output correctly identifies the Knight Foundation as the entity supporting CodePath's work in Miami. While the output provides additional details about the grant amount and specific activities, the core information matching the expected output is present and accurate.
1, The output accurately states the 50% time commitment, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output about the duration (six months prior to launch until six months post-launch) and the role (RBDD) does not contradict the core information, and can be considered as supplementary details that do not affect the accuracy of the main point.
1, The output conveys the same essential information as the expected output. Both indicate that something happens up to nine months before a region becomes operational. The output provides additional detail about an RBDD being assigned, but this doesn't contradict the expected output. The core timing information is consistent between the two.
1, The output accurately identifies the key roles mentioned in the expected output: Regional Business Development Directors (RBDDs) and Regional Program Managers (RPMs). While the output provides additional context about CodePath employing these roles to staff regions, this extra information does not detract from the core accuracy of the response. The essential information is present and correct.
1, The output accurately captures the essence of the expected output. While the output provides more detailed information, it correctly identifies the core purpose of the 'flywheel' model as creating a self-sustaining cycle of impacts by engaging various local stakeholders. The output mentions leveraging local interests in workforce development and social mobility, which aligns with the expected output. The additional details in the output do not contradict but rather expand on the expected answer, providing a more comprehensive explanation of how the model works to create cascading impacts.
1, The output accurately identifies the two regions mentioned in the expected output: New York City (NYC) and the DC-Maryland-Virginia metro (DMV). The additional phrase 'The regions indicated for potential CodePath launches in Spring 2025 are' does not affect the core information, which matches the expected output precisely.
1, The output correctly identifies the target demographic as 'Black, Latino/a, Indigenous, or low-income (BLI/LI) talent', which matches the expected output. The additional context about CodePath's aims does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output correctly states the percentage (80%) of early career talent working within 100 miles of their hometown, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output correctly identifies the key information about eight targeted metropolitan areas, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output (about CodePath's expansion plans over five years) does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
0, The output is partially correct but includes an additional institution (Capital One Foundation) that is not mentioned in the expected output. This extra information makes the answer inaccurate compared to the expected output, which only lists JP Morgan Chase Foundation.
0, The output is incorrect. The expected output is simply 'MacKenzie Scott', which is the direct answer to the implied question about the name associated with the foundation. The provided output instead explains that the name of the foundation is not mentioned, which is not the correct response. The output fails to provide the expected straightforward answer.
0, The output provided is a long list of technology companies, but it does not include Google, which is the only company mentioned in the expected output. While the output does contain many valid technology companies, it fails to include the specific company that was expected. Therefore, the output is considered incorrect in this context.
1, The output correctly identifies the Knight Foundation as a philanthropic organization mentioned in the document. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy, as the core information (Knight Foundation) matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly identifies Ford Motor Company as the company associated with the automotive industry in the provided snippet. The output matches the expected output exactly, with no discrepancies in content or meaning.
0, The output states there are 45 corporate partners, while the expected output indicates 47. This is a numerical discrepancy that affects the accuracy of the information, even if it's a small difference.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that CodePath is the philanthropic partner associated with the Ballmer Group, while the expected output indicates that 'Ballmer Group' itself is the correct answer. These are two different entities, and the output has misidentified the philanthropic partner.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the title of the second section is 'Appendix B: CodePath Founding Principles,' which is completely different from the expected output '2023-24 Philanthropic Partners.' These titles are not semantically similar and refer to different content.
0, The output is largely incorrect. While it correctly identifies Amazon as one of the corporate partners, it incorrectly lists Boeing and Microsoft, which are not mentioned in the expected output. The output is missing two of the three correct partners: Alteryx and Asurion. The accuracy is low, with only one out of three partners correctly identified.
0, The output 'The title of the document excerpt is "Appendices."' is completely different from the expected output '2023-24 Corporate Partners'. These are two distinct titles with no semantic similarity, indicating that the output is incorrect.
0, The output mentions Florida State University, while the expected output specifies University of Florida - Gainesville. These are two different universities in Florida. Although both are located in Florida, they are distinct institutions, so the answer is incorrect.
1, The output correctly includes New York University, which is the only university mentioned in the expected output. While the output lists additional universities, it does not detract from the accuracy of including the expected answer. The output demonstrates a more comprehensive list but still contains the correct information requested.

1, The output correctly identifies the University of California - Berkeley as the university in California with 'Berkeley' in its name. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
0, The output is incorrect. It states there are 96 universities listed in the document, while the expected output is 46. This is a significant numerical discrepancy that cannot be attributed to trivial inaccuracies or different units. The output's count is more than double the correct number, indicating a substantial error in the counting or interpretation of the data.
0, The output focuses solely on higher education institutions, while the expected output mentions a broader range of partners including universities, corporate entities, and philanthropic organizations. The output misses key elements (corporate and philanthropic partners) and provides excessive detail about educational institutions that is not relevant to the expected answer.
1, The output correctly identifies Dartmouth College as the Ivy League institution mentioned as a university partner. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy, as the core information matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly identifies that there are seven California State Universities mentioned in the document. The expected output 'Seven' matches the conclusion in the given output that 'there are 7 California State Universities mentioned in the document'. The output provides additional detail by listing the specific universities, but the core information about the number of universities is accurate.
0, The output is incorrect. It mentions Stanford University as a university partner, while the expected output states Alabama A&M University. These are two different institutions, and there is no semantic similarity between them.
0, The output is partially correct but missing a crucial part. While it correctly identifies 'University, Corporate, and Philanthropic Partners' as part of the title, it omits the year '2023-24' which is included in the expected output. This omission changes the specificity of the title and thus cannot be considered fully accurate.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to provide an answer, while the expected output gives a specific percentage (84%). This indicates that the output is incorrect, as it fails to provide the correct information that was apparently available in the given context.
0, The output is incorrect. It provides percentages of revenue growth (8% to 41%) instead of the actual revenue figures. The expected output gives specific dollar amounts ($28.1M to $44.1M) which are not reflected in the given output. The information provided in the output is fundamentally different from what was expected.
1, The output correctly includes the expected value of $0.05, which represents the amount CodePath spent internally per $1.00 of philanthropy secured in 2023. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output correctly states that CodePath intends for 60% of all philanthropic revenue to come from renewed or upgraded philanthropy by 2028, which matches the expected output of 60%. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. The only difference is that the output spells out 'million' while the expected output uses the abbreviation 'M'. The monetary value of $15 million is accurately represented in both cases.
1, The output accurately includes the key point from the expected output about creating regional advisory boards to foster engagement and build a network of supporters. While the output provides additional details about CodePath's strategy for high-net-worth individuals, it does not contradict or omit the core information from the expected output.
1, The output correctly states the expected annual growth rate as 30-40%, which matches exactly with the expected output. The additional context provided in the output ('The expected annual growth rate of total philanthropic revenue through 2026 is') does not affect the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output accurately captures the key point from the expected output, which is that the national foundation partners will help unlock regional funder support. While the output provides additional context and details, it does not contradict or misrepresent the core idea expressed in the expected output.
1, The output correctly includes the expected value of $18,401,500. While the output provides additional context by framing it as a prediction for corporate philanthropy in 2026, this extra information does not detract from the accuracy of the core numerical value, which matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output matches the expected output exactly. The total projected philanthropic revenue of $184,850,000 is correctly stated in the output.
1, The output accurately captures the key information from the expected output. It correctly states the increase from 82 to over 230 philanthropic investors. While the output provides the absolute increase (148) rather than the percentage increase (70%), this is not a significant error as it still conveys the substantial growth. The core information about the starting and ending numbers is correct, which is the most important aspect of the answer.
1, The output correctly states that MacKenzie Scott contributed $15 million to CodePath, which matches the expected output. The additional information about other donors does not contradict the expected output and can be considered supplementary detail.
1, The output is semantically correct. The amount stated in the output ($2.5 million) is equivalent to the expected output ($2.5M). The only difference is in the representation of 'million', which is spelled out in the output and abbreviated in the expected output. This is a trivial difference that doesn't affect the accuracy of the information provided.
0, The output provides detailed information about three philanthropic investor segments for CodePath's growth, but it does not match the expected output of 'Four'. The output lists three segments, not four, which is a significant semantic difference from the expected answer.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that over 40% of CodePath's philanthropic revenues came from national corporate foundations. The additional details in the output (specifying the years 2021-23 and using the term 'contributed') do not contradict the expected output and provide more context without changing the core meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the expected average salary of $92,000 for graduates who landed full-time tech jobs after completing CodePath's program. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output states that CodePath has served 20,344 unique students, while the expected output indicates 26,000 students. These numbers are significantly different, with a discrepancy of over 5,000 students. The output is therefore not accurate in terms of the number of students served.
0, The output does not provide the correct percentage (90%) and instead states that there is insufficient information to calculate the percentage. While the output's reasoning is logical based on the information it claims to have, it does not match the expected answer, which suggests that the required information was actually available.
1, The output is semantically equivalent to the expected output. The only difference is in the format: '$28.1 million' vs '$28.1M'. The numerical value (28.1) and the unit (million/M) are the same, making the answers effectively identical in meaning.
1, The output correctly includes the expected range of 50%-100% increase in philanthropic revenue. While the output provides additional context about this being per year for the last three years, the core information matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output provided does not match the expected output. The output discusses strategies for mitigating internal risks in generating revenue from higher education institutions, while the expected output mentions prioritizing experienced hires, investing in flagship university partnerships, and improving data systems. These are completely different sets of strategies with no overlap in content or focus.
0, The output calculates a specific percentage (10.79%) for 2028, which is higher than the expected 'never more than 7%'. The output's approach of estimating future revenues and calculating a precise percentage is more complex than necessary and misses the key point of the expected answer, which indicates a consistent upper limit across the entire plan period.
0, The output states that CodePath aims to achieve over $25M in revenue by 2028, while the expected output indicates $5.1M. This is a significant difference in the stated revenue target, making the output incorrect.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information that the expected cost will exceed $4, which matches the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its correctness.
1, The output correctly states that CodePath plans to grow its higher ed account team to 7 FTEs by 2028, which matches the expected output of 7 FTEs. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
0, The output does not provide the specific number of students projected for CodePath Partnered+ by 2028, which is 24,340 according to the expected output. Instead, it states that the exact number is not specified in the provided text. This indicates a significant discrepancy between the given output and the expected answer.
1, The output correctly states the cost as $206 per student per year, which matches the expected output of $206. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
0, The output states the projected average deal size per school in 2028 is $44.5K, which is significantly lower than the expected output of more than $400,000. The difference is too large to be considered a trivial inaccuracy or unit conversion error.
0, The output does not provide the specific number of higher education institutions (58) that CodePath plans to collaborate with. Instead, it states that this number is not explicitly mentioned in the provided information. The output focuses on the number of students (45,000) rather than the number of institutions, which is the expected answer.
1, The output is essentially correct. While the exact figure in the output ($2.6M) differs slightly from the expected output ($2.5M), this is a minor discrepancy that doesn't significantly alter the meaning of the response. The difference of $0.1M is relatively small in this context and could be due to rounding or a slight variation in projections. The core information about a substantial revenue increase for CodePath Partnered by 2028 is accurately conveyed.
1, The output correctly states the initial pricing test for CodePath Partnered is $75 per student per year, which matches the expected output of $75. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.

1, The output accurately includes the key information from the expected output, stating that confidence in higher education 'stands at an all-time low'. While the output provides additional context and consequences, it does not contradict or alter the core message of the expected output. The semantic meaning is preserved and expanded upon.
1, The output accurately captures the key concept of CodePath achieving efficiencies in program delivery as a means to enhance long-term sustainability. While the output provides more detailed information than the expected output, it does not contradict it. Both mention the idea of achieving efficiencies, and the output elaborates on how this contributes to sustainability. The semantic content is consistent, even though the phrasing differs.
0, The output provided is significantly different from the expected output. While the given output describes various strategies CodePath uses to strengthen relationships with employers, it does not specifically mention cultivating relationships at multiple levels within each employer or finding technical sponsors and HR champions. The expected output is much more focused and specific, while the given output is broader and covers different aspects of employer relationships.
0, The output provides specific revenue figures and predicts a decline, while the expected output simply states that it will exceed marginal cost. These are fundamentally different statements about the financial outcome, so the output is incorrect relative to the expected answer.
1, The output accurately captures the key information from the expected output. It correctly identifies mobilizing the alumni base as advocates and customers for CodePath products as a strategy to mitigate risks. The additional context provided in the output ('One strategy CodePath plans to use to mitigate risks is') does not alter the core meaning and can be considered as supplementary information that doesn't detract from the accuracy of the response.
1, The output accurately captures the key points from the expected output. Both mention mismatched needs, preference for competitors' offerings, and choosing in-house solutions as reasons for the growth projection mismatch. The output provides slightly more context but maintains the same core information, making it semantically equivalent to the expected output.
1, The output accurately captures all three key internal risks mentioned in the expected output. It provides the same information but in a more structured, numbered format. The content is semantically equivalent, covering growth pains in scaling, fractional leadership issues, and risks associated with a small team size.
1, The output correctly includes the year 2028, which matches the expected output. Although the output provides additional information about CodePath's revenue goal, it accurately contains the specific year requested.

0, While the output provides detailed information about CodePath's programs and their focus on practical skills and support for underrepresented students, it does not directly state the main goal of transforming college CS education to better support BLI/LI (Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Low Income) students. The output is more descriptive of the program's methods rather than its primary objective as stated in the expected output.
1, The output correctly includes the expected number of 1,330 industry volunteers. While the output provides additional context by specifying 'As of early 2024' and 'industry volunteers', the core information (1,330) matches the expected output exactly.
0, The output is incorrect as it does not provide the expected answer of $50 trillion. Instead, it states that the given snippet does not contain information about estimated economic output loss. The output and expected output are semantically different, with the output focusing on the absence of information rather than providing the specific figure requested.
1, The output correctly states the percentage (40%) that matches the expected output. While the output provides additional context, the core information (40%) is accurate and matches the expected answer.
1, The output correctly states the 5-year graduation rate for Native American students from four-year STEM bachelor's degree programs as 18.8%, which matches exactly with the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not affect the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output accurately identifies the primary barrier as the low rate at which BLI/LI young people graduate from college CS programs, which matches the expected output. The additional information provided in the output elaborates on this core point but does not contradict it.
1, The output accurately identifies the groups of young people mentioned in the expected output: Black, Latino/a, Indigenous, low-income, and first-generation (BLI/LI) young people. The output includes additional context by stating 'According to the document' and 'who face long odds in getting into software engineering', but these additions do not alter the core information, which matches the expected output exactly.
1, The output accurately states the 5-year completion rate for BLI/LI CS students as approximately 20%, which matches the expected output of ~20%. The use of 'approximately' instead of the tilde symbol (~) does not change the meaning and is considered a trivial difference.
1, The output correctly states the percentage as 15%, which matches exactly with the expected output. The additional context provided in the output does not affect the accuracy of the core information.
1, The output accurately conveys the same information as the expected output. While the format and wording differ, the key information - the amount of $261 million - is correctly stated. The additional context about CodePath's plans and the timeframe doesn't detract from the core accuracy of the financial figure.
0, The output is incorrect. It states that the projected cost per student served by CodePath in 2028 is not explicitly provided in the given information, while the expected output clearly states a specific figure of $599. The output fails to identify or provide this specific cost projection, which is the key information requested.
1, The output is semantically correct. While it provides more detail and uses 'million' instead of 'M', the core information about CodePath receiving $28.1 million in philanthropic support in 2023 is accurate and matches the expected output.
0, The output provides specific enrollment numbers and years, but does not directly state the 14X growth factor mentioned in the expected output. While the information given may be related, it doesn't explicitly convey the expected '14X' scaling factor, which is the key point of the expected answer.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information about CodePath's goal to serve 100,000 students by 2028. While the output provides additional context, the core information matches the expected output.
0, The output does not provide the specific figure of 'More than $1 trillion' as the estimated economic output loss per year. While the output correctly mentions a significant economic impact and 'trillions of dollars', it explicitly states that no precise annual loss figure is given. The expected output provides a specific estimate, which is not reflected in the given output.
1, The output accurately conveys the key information about CodePath's goal to reach 100,000 students. While the expected output specifies 'per year', which is not explicitly stated in the given output, the core concept of scaling to 100,000 students is correctly captured. The addition of the target year 2028 in the output provides more specific information but does not contradict the expected answer. The semantic meaning is essentially the same, focusing on CodePath's ambitious growth target.
0, The output states that there is insufficient information to answer the question, while the expected output provides a specific salary figure of $92,000. This indicates that the output is incorrect as it fails to provide the requested information that was apparently available.
0, The output states that CodePath has served 20,344 students, while the expected output indicates 26,000 students. This is a significant difference in numbers, not a trivial inaccuracy. The output is therefore incorrect in terms of the number of students served.
1, The output is essentially correct. While it doesn't provide the exact 15-20% range mentioned in the expected output, it does state 'about 16%', which falls within this range. The response accurately conveys the key information about the percentage of Black CS graduates transitioning to software engineering jobs within a year of graduation, even if it doesn't use the exact phrasing of the expected output.
1, The output accurately identifies 'Pillar 1: Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth' as the section following the 'Introduction to the 2024-28 Plan'. The content is identical to the expected output, with the only difference being the inclusion of additional context in the output, which does not affect its accuracy.
1, The output accurately captures the essence of the expected output. While the phrasing is different, it correctly identifies that Pillar 3 is about developing sustainable sources of revenue, which aligns with the expected output 'Sustainable Sources of Revenue'. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output accurately captures the main content of the expected output. The phrase 'Improve Effectiveness While Reducing Costs' is quoted verbatim within the output sentence, indicating that it correctly identifies the focus of Pillar 2 in the strategic plan. The additional context provided in the output does not detract from its accuracy.
1, The output accurately states the first pillar of the strategic plan, which is 'Scale Nationally in Breadth, and Regionally in Depth'. The additional text 'The first pillar of the strategic plan is:' does not affect the correctness of the core information provided.
1, The output accurately conveys the same time frame as the expected output. While the format is different (full years vs. abbreviated range), the semantic meaning is identical, covering the years 2024 to 2028.
